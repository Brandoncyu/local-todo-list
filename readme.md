# Local Todo List

A small example on how to use Node and the file system to create a todo list for your computer!

## Install

1. Fork/clone this repository

1. Run `npm run task-list "Complete my Local Todo List"`

1. Inspect the `list.txt` to see your added text!

## Instructions

To complete the todo list, you'll want to do the following:

- [ ] Update the `index.js` so that it will append each new task on a new line instead of overwriting it
- [ ] If you enter `"show"` as your task, instead of adding a new task read out all of the existing tasks
- [ ] Modify the above `"show"` functionality so that each task is numbered starting at 1
- [ ] If you enter `"remove [num]"` as the task, remove the task at the specified number
